# React Portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This has a dynamic header which shows the relevant content based on the section selected. All the content is created using React and react components. You will notice that as you navigate this page it does not render or refresh. 

This portfolio will be updated as I continue to build more projects. Here are some screen shots of the app:
